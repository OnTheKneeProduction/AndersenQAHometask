    <h1>Basics of testing</h1>
    <p>
        Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test.
        Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.
        Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects),
        and verifying that the software product is fit for use.
